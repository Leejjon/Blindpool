/**
 * <p>In French, a 'Poule' is some sort of competition where the participants
 * predict scores from sport matches. Poule isn't really an English word, so I
 * was kind of wondering what word to use for the English name. Even on
 * Wikipedia there doesn't really seem to be a word for it.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, in some cases the word "Pool" is being used. The phrase "prize pool"
 * is commonly used in lotteries. But it wasn't until I realized that Deadpool
 * is also a reference to the meaning of "Poule". In the Deadpool movie they
 * have a competition where they predict who is going to die first, and they
 * call it the dead pool. Later Wade Willson decides that it will become his
 * superhero name.</p>
